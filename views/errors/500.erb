<h2>500 - Internal error</h2>

<p>Looks like things got a little hairy while processing your request, because the server says:</p>

<code class="negative"><strong><%= response.body.first %></strong></code>

<p>It is highly likely that you have come across a bug in the application,
  and to consolidate the damages, our team would like to humbly present
  to you our most esteemed snowman: <br />
  <span class="snowman"></span>
</p>

<p>
  We would also kindly ask you to take a minute to <a href="<%= AppIssueURL %>">report this issue</a>
  to our technical team so we can improve the application and fix this problem.<br /><br />

  Thanks!
</p>
